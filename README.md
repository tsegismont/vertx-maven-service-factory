[![Build Status](https://vertx.ci.cloudbees.com/buildStatus/icon?job=vert.x3-maven-service-factory)](https://vertx.ci.cloudbees.com/view/vert.x-3/job/vert.x3-maven-service-factory/)

This is a `VerticleFactory` implementation which deploys a verticle given a service name and load it from a Maven 
repository.

The documentation is available [here](src/main/asciidoc/java/index.adoc), or on the the
[vert.x web site](http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-maven-service-factory/java).

## Build instructions

First you need to build the project from Maven:

`mvn clean package`

Once done, you can run the tests from your IDE.

Notice that the tests are using "projects" (actually, artifacts generated by theses projects) built during the Maven 
build.
